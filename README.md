Welcome to my GitHub! I am William (Billy) Dunn, and I'm a clinician (haematologist-in-training) and PhD student with an interest in applying data science and machine learning approaches to better understand an age-related phenomenon called clonal haematopoiesis.

## ü©∏ What is clonal haematopoiesis, and why should I care?
Clonal haematopoiesis (CH) occurs when a blood-forming stem cell in the bone marrow acquires a mutation that makes it "fitter", allowing that cell and its progeny to expand and dominate the bone marrow. This is very common with age, but importantly, it also precedes the development of blood cancers. Identifying and characterising CH is key to developing strategies to prevent blood cancers from developing in at-risk individuals. 

## üî¨ I'm currently working on...
- **Clonal Haematopoiesis Inferred from Counts (CHIC)** - Applying machine learning to complete blood count data to try and predict the presence of CH from a routine blood test.
- **Trees, telomeres and clonal haematopoiesis** - Examining phylogenetic relationships between CH clones and how this relates to their telomere length.
- **Clonal Monocytosis** - Examining the prevalence and significance of clonal monocytosis, a subset of CH characterised by high monocyte counts.

## üêç I'm currently learning... 
Most of my work to date has been written in R. As such, I enrolled on the [Learn2Discover](https://learntodiscover.ai) course to learn data handling and machine learning using Python. I'd say I'm now proficient in parseltongue, but I'm continuing to learn and improve!
